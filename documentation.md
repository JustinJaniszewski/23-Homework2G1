# Matrix Multiplication and Dot Product Comparison



We compared the execution time of different implementations of matrix operations and used Matrix Multiplication and Dot Product operations. We compared the execution time of different implementations for matrix multiplication and dot product operations in Python. We explored three methods:

1. **Using For Loops**
2. **Using NumPy Built-in Functions**
3. **Using NumPy Einstein Notation Function**

## Prerequisites
- Python (3) (IBM Quantum Lab)
- NumPy library

  ### 1. Using For Loops
For loop-based matrix multiplication is a straightforward method, but it may not be as efficient as numpy's built-in functions. Here's how you can implement it:
